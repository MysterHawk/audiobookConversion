The circle goes like this

You convert everything in WAV (lopp_conversion_wav) --> cut the silence between the audiobooks-->
--> convert everything to opus

This is a old series of script that I used, with times I prefered not to use cut the silence between the audio file
So yeah I will just use the batch conversion to opus that is always convenient for mobile use.


I have to say, it script to cut the space was balanced, but you need a bit of time to understand the meaning of the phrases in the book.

The original script is from this article:

The fastbook script has a bug though, it work with mono audiobook not stereo, I tried to fix it in the script,
but I couldnt do it!
